Wrong answer causes it to lock. Threading threw errors.

# Comments
You have many line-by-line comments that are descriptive and give a sense of what discrete parts of the code do and what certain variables hold. I would have liked to have seen more comments talking about the flow of the program and doing things like introducing functions and classes.

# Code Quality
This is a genuinely impressive project. You figured out the answer randomizer on your own and played with threading, something I didn't mention in class at all. There were things that caused the program to lock if certain choices were selected, and the threading sometimes threw an error, but, overall, I'm extremely impressed by your initiative in researching packages and ideas to use in this project.

# Ambition
Similar to the Quality comments above, the ambition here is all the more impressive given how much of your initial vision you were able to complete. This project is almost everything you said you wanted to do in your proposal.
