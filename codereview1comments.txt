It's hard to comment on this version of the code given the changed version I spoke with you about yesterday. I'll focus on documentation since that's the primary goal of this code review: recall that the assignment asks for full introductory comments on your functions that explain not just what they do and why and where they fit into the larger scheme of your project. You do some of that here, but I would encourage you to be more descriptive. I would also encourage you to do a bit more to encapsulate some of what you have here in the ways that we talked about yesterday with the question asking system: the "declare a function then immediately invoke it" pattern is more prone to error than something like having a single function that can be called repeatedly using different arguments, as you did with the question asking yesterday.
